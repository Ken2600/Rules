*No advertising in the Discord server or via DM
If you are a new member, you will instantly be banned as it shows you joined this community just to advertise.

*Be nice
Don't be rude to people or be a bad influence for them, especially those who are helping you. If someone else is rude to you, the staff will take care of it.

*Don't annoy the staff

*Use mentions only when necessary
As stated above, there are many active and knowledgeable users in the server. For example, if you have an issue that basically anyone can help you with, there's no need to mention anyone (especially not staff). Post your issue in #support and wait.
"But it's just a mention, what's wrong with it?"

*Stay on-topic
Don't ask for help in #suggestions and don't talk about your day in #support. Related topics and small digressions are fine for short periods of time, but try your best to abide by these guidelines and switch channels when asked to. Otherwise, you will be muted in that channel.

Bans are final. There are no exceptions.

We generally try to follow this when moderating but we reserve the right to expel any user we believe is detrimental to the community.
